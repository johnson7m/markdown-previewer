Markdown previewer for FCC front-end-development course

Notes:
1.) this files are just src/public files and are meant to ran inside a node server
2.) used the marked api to handle parsing
3.) very barebones.
4.) I copied the sameple text from FCC's editor example simply to have a good way to test each functionality of the parser.
5.) easy to use
